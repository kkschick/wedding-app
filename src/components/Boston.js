                Boston is known as the quintessential walkable city. Indeed, the central part of Boston is surprisingly compact. If the weather is nice, there’s no better way to get introduced to this lovely, historic city—the birthplace of the American Revolution—than by beginning with a walking tour.<br/><br/>
                It’s easy to do a walking tour on your own, going at a leisurely pace, and stopping to browse and eat whenever you fancy. Here’s the route we’ve walked many times (check it out on Google Maps):<br/>
              </span><br/><br/>
              <span className="small-text">
                Get off at the Charles T stop, walk down Charles Street and up into Beacon Hill, a quaint neighborhood of Federal-style rowhouses, renowned for its narrow, gas-lit streets and brick sidewalks. You can walk up Pinckney Street and return to Charles Street via Mt Vernon or Chestnut Street. Meander your way through the different streets of Beacon Hill but make sure not to miss Acorn Street, a tiny picturesque street (where you will end up taking many pictures), as well as Louisbourg Square (check out #10, Louisa May Alcott’s former home). After you return to Charles Street, cut through the lovely Public Garden (read about the Swans Boats below), walk down Commonwealth Ave to Berkeley Street, and then turn right onto Newbury Street (read about Newbury Street below).

                The Freedom Trail<br/><br/>

              <span className="paragraph-text">
                <a href="https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/" target="_blank">The Freedom Trail</a> is a 2.5 mile route that takes you by 16 historically significant sites from museums to churches to graveyards. You can sign up for a guided tour, but it’s easy and more flexible to pick up a free map of the Freedom Trail, pick out the part you want to walk and follow the “red brick road” (actually, a red painted line in the cement). Some sights worth checking out include the Granary Burying Ground where Revolutionary heroes like Paul Revere and Sam Adams are buried, the Old Corner Book Store (the oldest commercial building in Boston), Paul Revere’s House, and the Old North Church (where Revere signalled “one if by land and two if by sea” at the start of the American Revolution). Going to the Old North Church will take you into the historic Italian neighborhood of Boston called the North End, where you’ll find many good Italian restaurants, as well as some of the best cannoli desserts.

                One of the most famous (and relaxing) traditions for Boston sightseers and residents alike is to take a whirl on the swan boats in the Public Garden, just as people have done every year since 1877. While the swan boat driver pedals the boat around the lagoon, lean back and enjoy the sights, including the island of “Make Way for Ducklings” fame.<br/><br/>

                <strong><a href="http://www.bostonchildrensmuseum.org/visit" target="_blank">Boston Children's Museum</a><br/></strong>
                With a giant milk bottle statue at the front of the building, it's hard to miss the Boston Children's Museum. Here, hands-on exhibits present a fun way to learn about different subjects like science, culture, and health, as well as make huge soap bubbles, use construction equipment, climb a three-story structure, etc. Katie was a frequent visitor to this museum when she was young.<br/><br/>

                For a more whimsical art museum, check out this hidden gem. When you walk into the courtyard, you might think you were in a Venetian palace. We liked to visit the Gardner as much for its unique architectural setting as for the eclectic art displayed there. The museum’s old courtyard and palace are juxtaposed against a modernist glass extension, and the lovely garden is a contemplative setting for enjoying the architecture.<br/><br/>

                If you’re ready for some eating and browsing, head over to this crowded, energy-packed area of Boston. First, look in at historic Faneuil Hall, where colonists established the doctrine of “no taxation without representation.” Then, go check out the street performers and make your way through the marketplace buildings where you’ll find a food court with a dizzying array of culinary temptations, as well as many push carts and shops selling all kinds of wares, both kitschy and sublime.<br/><br/>
                When you’ve had enough of the hustle and bustle, keep walking towards the Boston Harbor to the <strong>Waterfront Park.</strong> Here, you can sit, relax, and enjoy the ocean view or, if you have the time and energy, take a <strong><a href="http://www.bostonharborcruises.com/" target="_blank">Boston Harbor cruise</a></strong> or visit the nearby famous <strong><a href="http://www.neaq.org/visit/" target="_blank">Boston Aquarium.</a></strong><br/><br/>

                <strong><a href="http://www.newbury-st.com/" target="_blank">Newbury Street</a></strong><br/>
                Over a period of 25 years beginning in 1857, the city created the section of town now known as the Back Bay by filling in part of Boston Harbor. Over the years, about eight blocks of this Back Bay street has become famous as a uniquely Boston destination lined with boutiques, galleries, and eateries, housed in charming brownstones. Note that this street is close to the Boston Public Library.<br/><br/>

                We have to admit that even though we’ve walked by the Boston Tea Ship many times, we’ve never actually paid for the Boston Tea Party experience so we suggest you read the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60745-d103645-Reviews-Boston_Tea_Party_Ships_Museum-Boston_Massachusetts.html" target="_blank">Tripadvisor reviews</a> first and decide for yourself whether it’s worthwhile. The experience is supposed to involve high-tech, interactive exhibits and live actors re-enacting the night in December 1773 that the Sons of Liberty dumped chests of tea overboard.<br/><br/>
                <strong><a href="https://ussconstitutionmuseum.org/" target="_blank">USS Constitution</a></strong><br/>
                During the War of 1812, the USS Constitution defeated four British frigates during three separate engagements. This ship earned the nickname "Old Ironsides" because the cannon fire from enemy ships seemed as if it couldn't penetrate her strong oak hull. Tours of the ship are available.
